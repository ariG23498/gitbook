description: How to configure the W&B Local Server installation
---

# Advanced Configuration

Your W&B Local Server comes up ready-to-use on boot. However, several advanced configuration options are available, at the `/system-admin` page on your server once it's up and running. You can email [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com) to request a trial license to enable more users and teams.

## Configuration as code

All configuration settings can be set via the UI however if you would like to manage these configuration options via code you can set the following environment variables:

**LICENSE** - Your wandb/local license  
**MYSQL** - The MySQL connection string  
**BUCKET** - The S3 / GCS bucket for storing data  
**BUCKET\_QUEUE** - The SQS / Google PubSub queue for object creation events  
**NOTIFICATIONS\_QUEUE** - The SQS queue on which to publish run events  
**AWS\_REGION** - The AWS Region where your bucket lives  
**HOST** - The FQD of your instance, i.e. [https://my.domain.net](https://my.domain.net)  
**AUTH0\_DOMAIN** - The Auth0 domain of your tenant  
**AUTH0\_CLIENT\_ID** - The Auth0 Client ID of application

## Authentication

By default, a W&B Local Server run with manual user management enabling up to 4 users. Licensed versions of _wandb/local_ also unlock SSO using Auth0.

Your server supports any authentication provider supported by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). You should set up your own Auth0 domain and application that will be under your teams' control.

After creating an Auth0 app, you'll need to configure your Auth0 callbacks to the host of your W&B Server. By default, the server supports http from the public or private IP address provided by the host. You can also configure a DNS hostname and SSL certificate if you choose.

* Set the Callback URL to `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST`
* Set the Allowed Web Origin to `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST`
* Set the Logout URL to `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST/logout`

Save the Client ID and domain from your Auth0 app.

![Auth0 Settings](../.gitbook/assets/auth0-2.png)

Then, navigate to the W&B settings page at `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST/admin-settings`. Enable the "Customize Authentication with Auth0" option, and fill in the Client ID and domain from your Auth0 app.

Finally, press "Update settings and restart W&B".

## File Storage

By default, a W&B Enterprise Server saves files to a local data disk with a capacity that you set when you provision your instance. To support limitless file storage, you may configure your server to use an external cloud file storage bucket with an S3-compatible API.

### Amazon Web Services

To use an AWS S3 bucket as the file storage backend for W&B, you'll need to create a bucket, along with an SQS queue configured to receive object creation notifications from that bucket. Your instance will need permissions to read from this queue.

**Create an SQS Queue**

First, create an SQS Standard Queue. Add a permission for all principals for the `SendMessage` and `ReceiveMessage` actions as well as `GetQueueUrl` . \(If you like you can further lock this down using an advanced policy document.\)

**Create an S3 Bucket and Bucket Notifications**

Then, create an S3 bucket. Under the bucket properties page in the console, in the "Events" section of "Advanced Settings", click "Add notification", and configure all object creation events to be sent to the SQS Queue you configured earlier.

Enable CORS access: your CORS configuration should look like the following:

```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>http://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-IP</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

**Grant permissions to node running W&B**

The node on which W&B Local is running must be configured to perrmit access to s3 and sqs. Depending on the type of server deployment you've opted for, you may need to add the following policy statements to your node role:

```
{
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":"s3:*",
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::<WANDB_BUCKET>"
      },
      {
         "Sid":"",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "sqs:*"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:sqs:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT>:<WANDB_QUEUE>"
      }
   ]
}
```

**Configure W&B Server**

Finally, navigate to the W&B settings page at `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST/admin-settings`. Enable the "Use an external file storage backend" option, and fill in the s3 bucket, region, and SQS queue in the following format:

* **File Storage Bucket**: `s3://<bucket-name>`
* **File Storage Region**: `<region>`
* **Notification Subscription**: `sqs://<queue-name>`

Press "update settings and restart W&B" to apply the new settings.

### Google Cloud Platform

To use a GCP Storage bucket as a file storage backend for W&B, you'll need to create a bucket, along with a pubsub topic and subscription configured to receive object creation messages from that bucket.

**Create Pubsub Topic and Subscription**

Navigate to Pub/Sub &gt; Topics in the GCP Console, and click "Create topic". Choose a name and create a topic.

Then click "Create subscription" in the subscriptions table at the bottom of the page. Choose a name, and make sure Delivery Type is set to "Pull". Click "Create".

Make sure the service account or account that your instance is running as has access to this subscription.

**Create Storage Bucket**

Navigate to Storage &gt; Browser in the GCP Console, and click "Create bucket". Make sure to choose "Standard" storage class.

Make sure the service account or account that your instance is running as has access to this bucket.

**Create Pubsub Notification**

Creating a notification stream from the Storage Bucket to the Pubsub Topic can unfortunately only be done in the console. Make sure you have `gsutil` installed, and logged into the correct GCP Project, then run the following:

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics list  # list names of topics for reference
gsutil ls                  # list names of buckets for reference

# create bucket notification
gsutil notification create -t <TOPIC-NAME> -f json gs://<BUCKET-NAME>
```

[Further reference is available on the Cloud Storage website.](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reporting-changes)

**Add Signing Permissions**

To create signed file URLs, your W&B instance also needs the `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` permission in GCP. You can add it by adding the `Service Account Token Creator` role to the service account or IAM member that your instance is running as.

**Configure W&B Server**

Finally, navigate to the W&B settings page at `http(s)://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-HOST/admin-settings`. Enable the "Use an external file storage backend" option, and fill in the s3 bucket, region, and SQS queue in the following format:

* **File Storage Bucket**: `gs://<bucket-name>`
* **File Storage Region**: blank
* **Notification Subscription**: `pubsub:/<project-name>/<topic-name>/<subscription-name>`
